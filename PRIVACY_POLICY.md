Privacy Policy

This Chrome extension (“Job Application Tracker”) respects user privacy and is committed to protecting personal data.

Data Collection
The extension collects only data that the user explicitly provides, such as job application details (company name, role, status, notes). It also uses Google Sign-In for authentication and may access the active tab URL when the user chooses to add an application from a job posting page.

Data Usage
Collected data is used solely to provide the core functionality of the extension, including saving, displaying, and managing job applications, authenticating users, and optionally prefilling application information at the user’s request.

Data Storage
User data is stored securely and is accessible only to the authenticated user. The extension does not perform background tracking or passive data collection.

Data Sharing
The extension does not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties. Data is not used for advertising, analytics, or marketing purposes.

User Control
Users may edit or delete their data at any time and can sign out to stop identity-based access.

Changes
This privacy policy may be updated if functionality changes. Continued use of the extension indicates acceptance of the policy.

Contact
For questions or concerns, contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing.
